### 🔧 Install prerequisites (once for a machine)

* **Node Installation:** [Install node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) [Recommended LTS version]

### 🖥️ Local setup

After successfully installing those dependencies, open this template with any IDE [[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended], and then open the internal terminal of IDM [vs code shortcut <code>ctrl/cmd+\`</code>]
